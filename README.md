When working on the program:

1. Before you make any changes at the beginning of the day run "git pull origin main" (this way is someone pushed and merged something you get the updates)

2. Before you work on anything create/move to your branch. (Check your branch with "git status". Create a branch with "git checkout -b {Branch-name}. Move branches with "git checkout {Branch-name}.

3. After any push and merge. You will need to do a "git pull origin main". If you were the one pushing it, move to the main branch and immediately do "git pull".

Following these steps will make it so that we have as few times as possible redoing the same things over again.
